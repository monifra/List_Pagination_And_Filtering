Techdegree Project 2 List_Pagination_And_Filtering

  In this project I enhance the web page with pagination technique. List Filter and Pagination project
  uses pagination technique to show maximum ten students at the page.
  It creates a navigation to let the user see the rest of the student by clicking on links inside the navigation.
  It has a search bar that allows to search the list of student, shows ones that match,
  adds pagination if there are more than ten results, adjust in real time when you change the words you search
  and throws an error message when no match were found.
